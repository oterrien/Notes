# CQRS

CQRS on itself is a very simple pattern. It only prescribes that the component of an application that processes commands should be separated from the component that processes queries. Although this separation is very simple on itself, it provides a number of very powerful features when combined with other patterns. Axon provides the building blocks that make it easier to implement the different patterns that can be used in combination with CQRS.
